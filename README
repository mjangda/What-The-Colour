what the colour?! is a cool way to find images matching colour palettes. It mashes up the Piximilar and colourslovers.com APIs.

This sweet app built over the period of 5-6 hours at the first HackTO hosted by Idee Inc. in Toronto.

Be warned that the code is messy. And the app doesn't fully work anymore (you can get palettes but not images).
